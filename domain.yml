  utter_attendance_policy:
    - text: "Students are expected to attend the university on a full-time basis during each semester.
             Attendance is checked during seminars, tutorials and labs and the student's attendance status
             is announced on real-time basis to each students but lectures are not checked as students are expected
             to be responsible for their own attendance when it comes to lectures.
             Attendance checks take place at any time from the beginning or end of seminars, tutorials and
             labs. Students must attend at least 75% of the tutorials and practical labs. If absence exceeds
             the allowed percentage: 25% (either excused - as the excuse does not mean that the content is
             delivered- or unexcused) in the same course, the student will not be allowed to sit for the
             exam of the relevant subject and will have to drop the course and retake the course when
             available. In the event of an absence (excused or unexcused): No make up will be given for the
             missed assignments or quizzes unless the Doctor himself/herself asssigns a make-up, The lecturer will
             select best 2 out of 3 Or 3 out of 4 quizzes or assignments for the
             benefit of the student and in case of absence during a quiz or an assignment, the
             student will miss the opportunity of selecting the best quizzes or assignments and
             will be evaluated on the remaining quizzes and assignments.
             If a student attends other than his/her scheduled classes, the attendance, assignments and
             quizzes will not be counted."
  utter_attendance_excuse:
    - text: "Official accepted excuses will only affect the payment of the course and not the results as the
             academic quality of GUC students depends on attendance and participation in the teaching /
             learning process to achieve the objectives of the courses.
             Official accepted excuses by the University are limited to:
             Medical excuse from the university clinic, Death of a close relative. Limited to father, mother,
             brother or sister, and Events and Competitions:
             a. National
             b. Regional
             c. International
             d. Events and Competitions Representing GUC
             A student who is absent with an accepted excuse will be dealt with as follows:
              - Overall absence should not exceed 25%
              - Must submit official excuse and must be approved by the university
              - Will be counted as absent with excuse
              - Will receive warnings if s/he exceeds 25%, and will be informed that s/he is not
                registered in the course and will have to retake the course when it is available next time.
              - Will not pay for the repeated course. In case of unexcued absence
              A student will be dealt with using the same way as for
              excused absence mentioned above however, the student will have to pay for the repeated course
              If the student has a mix of excused and unexcused absence, payment for the repeated course
              will depend on the percentage of excused versus the unexcused absence. If the percentage of
              the unexcused absence is larger, the student will have to pay. If the percentage of the excused
              absence is larger, the student will not pay.
              Students who exceed the unexcused/excused percentage of absence in the Practical Labs,
              but do not exceed the limit of absence in Tutorials and Lectures will be permitted to only
              the theoretical final exam and not to the practical final exam within the following two
              semesters. The grade of the whole course will be “IP” (Incomplete Practical) and the student will
              have to attend only the practical course again whenever is available.
              The grades of the theoretical part will be kept and added to the grades of the practical part
              when attended and the course grade is then calculated and announced.
              The grades of the practical part will be kept and added to the grades of the theoretical part
              when attended and the course grade is then calculated and announced."

             In case of illness or accidents, the absence form must be filled out and submitted
             with the supporting documents within one week of the incident to Students Affairs.
             If one week passes without an absence form filled out, the student, or one of his
             family members must show proof that there were extreme circumstances
             preventing submission of the absence form. Medical excuses must be approved by the
